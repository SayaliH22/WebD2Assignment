This is a responsive portfolio website, developed using HTML and CSS. 

I have included polygon property to enrich the UI.
The header section contains: 
Navigation bar: Which guides to the various sections within the website.
Contact button: The contact button directs to the contact section which enables the visitor to send email to my email ID.
Image: Professional image which is adjusted to the left with the margin-right property of CSS.
Download Resume: The Download Resume button is present with the help of which PDF of my resume can be downloaded. 

HTML Tags used: <header> <nav> <h1> <h6> <li> <a> <br> <div>

The next section contains a basic summary/information about me. The container containing the section is applied with the flex property.
The text is aligned in the center and icons of the social media with their links are displayed in the bottom. 
The social media icons also have a hover effect on them.

Next section is the education section where I have displayed my education history. I have used the grid property of CSS to build the card wrapper.
Images of the logos of my educational institutes have been added using the <img> tag. Hover effect is added on the cards.

The next section showcases my project work. I have included 4 projects from different areas. Images are added and links are added which redirects 
to git where the project is uploaded. Here too I have used the grid property of CSS.

Next is the contact section where I have used the <form> tag with which I have created the form. I have also used the action attribute for the mail to option
which sends mail to the specific mail ID. I have also added my phone number and email ID.

In the footer section, I have added the links of my social media pages using the <a> tag and href attribute.
